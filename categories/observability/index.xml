These two approaches define how measurements are reported over time, and different metrics systems have their preferences based on their design and use cases. In this blog post, we’ll explore the difference between delta and cumulative metrics, examine their trade-offs, and highlight the systems that prefer one over the other.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="understanding-temporality">&lt;strong>Understanding Temporality&lt;/strong>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Temporality refers to the way metrics are recorded and reported over time. Choosing the right temporality depends on your monitoring backend and analytical needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cumulative Temporality&lt;/strong>: Reports the running total of a metric from the beginning of a measurement period. Suitable for tracking trends and totals. Example: Total bytes transferred over time (&lt;a class="link" href="https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/25/how-to-use-opentelemetry-and-grafana-alloy-to-convert-delta-to-cumulative-at-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>source&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Delta Temporality&lt;/strong>: Reports the difference in value for a metric since the last measurement. Ideal for real-time insights into changes over intervals. Example: Number of requests processed per interval (&lt;a class="link" href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/metric-temporality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>source&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>OpenTelemetry&lt;/strong> provides flexibility by supporting both delta and cumulative metrics. This allows observability platforms to choose a model that aligns with their architecture (&lt;a class="link" href="https://opentelemetry.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>learn more&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cumulative Metrics&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>These represent the total value accumulated from the start of the measurement up to the current point.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every reported value includes all previous measurements, providing a running total.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Example:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>At time t0: 5&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At time t0+10s: 10&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At time t0+20s: 20&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Prometheus documentation explains how cumulative counters are processed&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Use case&lt;/strong>: Cumulative metrics are ideal when you need a holistic view of total occurrences, such as the total number of requests or errors since the application started. They also help mitigate data loss because missed intervals can still be accounted for in subsequent reports.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Delta Metrics&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Delta metrics report only the change in value since the last measurement.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each value reflects the increment or decrement during a specific reporting interval.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Example:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>At time t0: 5&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At time t0+10s: 5&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At time t0+20s: 10&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

>Learn more about delta metrics and how they&amp;rsquo;re handled in OpenTelemetry&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Use case&lt;/strong>: Delta metrics are great for analyzing the rate of change over specific intervals. They’re especially useful in systems designed for high-frequency reporting where capturing incremental updates is more efficient.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Prometheus&lt;/strong>: Cumulative metrics are the default. Counters track the total value over time, and functions like &lt;code>rate()&lt;/code> derive per-second rates.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Google Cloud Monitoring&lt;/strong>: Uses cumulative metrics to represent continuous totals, like the number of requests served.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Amazon CloudWatch&lt;/strong>: Designed around cumulative metrics, with built-in support for rate and delta calculations.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h4 id="metrics-systems-using-delta-metrics">&lt;strong>Metrics Systems Using Delta Metrics&lt;/strong>
&lt;/h4>&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>OpenTelemetry (OTLP)&lt;/strong>: Delta temporality is supported for certain metric types, allowing granular reporting over intervals.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>StatsD&lt;/strong>: Metrics like counters are reported as deltas, focusing on changes during the last interval for lightweight and efficient ingestion.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Datadog&lt;/strong>: Prefers delta metrics for some integrations to provide detailed visibility into per-second rates.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h4 id="systems-supporting-both-delta-and-cumulative-metrics">&lt;strong>Systems Supporting Both Delta and Cumulative Metrics&lt;/strong>
&lt;/h4>&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>OpenTelemetry&lt;/strong>: Provides flexibility by allowing users to configure metrics as either cumulative or delta.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Grafana Mimir and Cortex&lt;/strong>: While aligned with Prometheus&amp;rsquo; cumulative approach, these systems can process both formats.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Elastic Observability&lt;/strong>: Supports both, though cumulative metrics are more effective for long-term storage and trend analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Splunk Observability Cloud&lt;/strong>: Handles both delta and cumulative metrics, adapting to the data source requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="choosing-the-right-temporality">&lt;strong>Choosing the Right Temporality&lt;/strong>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>When deciding between delta and cumulative metrics, consider the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>System Compatibility&lt;/strong>: Some systems (e.g., Prometheus) work better with cumulative metrics, while others (e.g., StatsD) prefer deltas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Data Loss Resilience&lt;/strong>: Cumulative metrics are more forgiving when intervals are missed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Analysis Needs&lt;/strong>: Use delta metrics for fine-grained interval analysis and cumulative metrics for overall trends and totals.&lt;/li>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Phillip Carter&amp;rsquo;s blog &lt;a class="link" href="https://phillipcarter.dev/2024/09/14/the-observability-cap-theorem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&amp;ldquo;The Observability CAP Theorem&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> explores the challenging balancing act of building and managing observability systems for high-traffic organizations, something which resonates with me. It explores the trade-offs between key features of observability—like cost, data detail, retention, and query efficiency—and how organizations have to prioritize based on their specific needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One big takeaway is that no system can excel at everything. For example, making data queries fast and efficient might mean sacrificing how much data you can store long-term or how detailed that data is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another point that stood out is how observability priorities change over time. What works today might need to evolve as your company grows, regulations change, or new tools emerge. With that in mind, I wanted to write some thoughts and takeaways from the blog—both to reflect on and as a guide for future decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="properties-of-observability">Properties of Observability
&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Quick and efficient real-time querying of your data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sufficient historical data availability per query, ranging from days to years&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Comprehensive access to relevant data for a specific context&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cost-effective operations that align with budgetary expectations&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="trade-offs-in-observability-systems">Trade-offs in Observability Systems
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Due to the challenges of managing large volumes of data, observability systems often make trade-offs to optimize for specific use cases or properties. These trade-offs include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comprehensive Metric Storage vs. Investigation Efficiency&lt;/strong>: Observability systems may prioritize the ability to cheaply store and observe metrics for extensive datasets, but this can come at the cost of making in-depth investigations into root causes more challenging.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Extensive Log Retention vs. Query Costs&lt;/strong>: Systems may enable the retention of all log data, even in a user-managed cloud environment, but this often involves incurring costs for each query or analysis performed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fast Trace Queries vs. Sampling Trade-offs&lt;/strong>: To enable fast querying and analysis of trace data, systems may rely on effective sampling techniques, potentially reducing the completeness of the data available for analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Unified Data Ingestion vs. User Experience Fragmentation&lt;/strong>: Systems that allow all types of data to be sent to a single tool may result in inconsistent user experiences, depending on the type of data being analyzed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Uniform Analysis Across Data Sources vs. Specialized Capabilities&lt;/strong>: Tools that offer consistent analysis and visualization for all data types may sacrifice advanced features optimized for specific kinds of telemetry data.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="prioritizing-observability-properties-for-companies-generating-high-volume-traffic">&lt;strong>Prioritizing Observability Properties for companies generating high volume traffic&lt;/strong>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>For experienced engineers in organizations, unsampled high volume data can be stored cost-effectively in long-term archives, priorities shift to emphasize real-time operational efficiency. The updated order of importance is as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fast Queries for Incident Response&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Quick access to actionable insights during incidents is critical for minimizing downtime and addressing urgent issues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Engineers value systems that enable rapid querying over recent, relevant data, as this directly impacts the ability to resolve problems efficiently.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Efficient Sampling and Aggregation&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Effective techniques like sampling, filtering, and aggregation allow teams to maintain representativeness while reducing data volume and cost.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This ensures that a smaller, relevant subset of data is readily available in fast-querying stores, while the rest can be archived for later use if needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cost-Effective Compliance Data Retention&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Compliance data can be stored in low-cost archival systems (e.g., object storage like AWS S3 or similar solutions), minimizing its impact on operational observability costs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Retrieval and processing can be deferred to meet regulatory requirements without affecting real-time observability needs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cost-Conscious Operations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Observability costs must align with organizational budgets. Prioritizing cost-effective tools and strategies ensures observability delivers value without overextending financial resources.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open-source solutions or tiered pricing models for commercial tools can help manage costs effectively.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Observability handles different types of data streams with unpredictable volumes. The trade-offs in observability systems are rooted in technical and organizational realities. The ultimate impact of these trade-offs often depends on an organization’s unique priorities, such as tolerance for incident duration, audit requirements, tool standardization, and budget constraints. These priorities can shift over time due to internal dynamics or external pressures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Another Off-by-One (Mostly) Problem and Prometheus Counter Spikes</title><link>https://hashimcolombowala.com/p/another-off-by-one-mostly-problem-and-prometheus-counter-spikes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 21:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://hashimcolombowala.com/p/another-off-by-one-mostly-problem-and-prometheus-counter-spikes/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="the-problem">The Problem
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We have observed several Prometheus counters showing false spikes (i.e., no matching increase in logs) that could correlate with nodes experiencing kernel panics and reboots.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-do-counters-spike">Why Do Counters Spike?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In Prometheus, counters are expected to be monotonic: they can never decrease. The only time a counter timeseries can decrease is if it is reset to zero (e.g., when a container restarts).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The PromQL functions &lt;code>increase()&lt;/code> and &lt;code>rate()&lt;/code> have special logic to handle counter resets like this. If a counter has a value of 100 and the next data point is 99, it is assumed that the timeseries was first reset to 0 and then incremented 99 more times. This would cause a jump of 99 in most graphs.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="background">Background
&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our Python app is running on a Gunicorn server with multiple workers. This means multiple Python processes are serving requests because Python&amp;rsquo;s threading is restricted by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Using multiprocessing is a good workaround.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The app is running on a pod on a Kubernetes node.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This app is instrumented with the Prometheus Python client in multiprocessing mode because each worker process runs independently and maintains separate metrics. Multiprocessing mode aggregates these metrics across all workers, ensuring that Prometheus scrapes produce accurate, unified data across the entire application, reflecting all requests handled by all workers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In multiprocessing mode, each process writes its metrics to a separate &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/prometheus/client_python/blob/v0.12.0/prometheus_client/mmap_dict.py#L61-L69" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>set of mmapped files&lt;/a>. On scrape, the exporter web server reads all of these files and merges them (i.e., counters from process A and B are summed). In our Kubernetes setup, these files are stored in &lt;code>/tmp&lt;/code>, which is mounted as a Kubernetes &lt;code>emptyDir&lt;/code> volume in most of our workloads.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="how-are-reboots-causing-spikes">How Are Reboots Causing Spikes?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>It turns out the &lt;code>emptyDir&lt;/code> mounted to &lt;code>/tmp&lt;/code> persists across container crashes&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were able to exec into a pod that experienced a node reboot and confirmed that the filesystem timestamps in the metric files predated the node reboot by several days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hashimcolombowala.com/p/another-off-by-one-mostly-problem-and-prometheus-counter-spikes/shell.png"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>This means that after a reboot, pods are coming back with their old counter values&lt;/strong>. This would normally be fine as long as the node is not down for too long—the counter would just resume at the previous value and see no reset, as long as it hasn&amp;rsquo;t fallen out of the backend aggregator&amp;rsquo;s buffer (which has a 10-minute window in our setup).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the backend, we drilled into the raw data points for the counter during one of the spikes and noticed it was incrementing and then decrementing by exactly one:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;h3 id="sequence-of-events">Sequence of Events
&lt;/h3>&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The application process increments a counter from &lt;em>n&lt;/em> to &lt;em>n+1&lt;/em> and writes the value to the mmapped file. This writes to the Linux kernel&amp;rsquo;s page cache (and is not immediately flushed to disk).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A scrape occurs. The multiprocess exporter opens and reads all files. The kernel sees some of the files are already in the page cache and skips reading them from disk. The scrape exports the counter as &lt;em>n+1&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A kernel panic happens before the page cache is flushed to disk. The counter increment is lost.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The node encounters a kernel panic and reboots. Since the shutdown was not graceful, pods remain assigned to the node, so after startup containers are restarted with the same pod names, etc. Since the pod name is the same, the &lt;code>emptyDir&lt;/code> volume is reused, and the pod keeps the last counter value that was flushed to disk (&lt;em>n&lt;/em>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A scrape occurs, and we export the counter with a value of &lt;em>n&lt;/em>. Prometheus queries run &lt;code>increase([..., n+1, n])&lt;/code>, which is interpreted as an increase of &lt;em>n&lt;/em>, causing a spike.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>However, we have not attempted to reproduce this behavior to confirm this theory. Since this depends on the timing of the kernel writing the dirty page to disk and the kernel panic, it also makes sense that we would not see this behavior consistently with node restarts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-can-we-fix-it">How Can We Fix It?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>While a fix for the node reboot issue has been identified, we can be more robust here. The simplest solution is to clear out the metric files in &lt;code>/tmp&lt;/code> on startup. Prometheus is designed for this—counter resets are normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We could set the Prometheus multiproc directory to a memory-backed &lt;code>emptyDir&lt;/code> volume (&lt;code>emptyDir.medium: Memory&lt;/code>). This would naturally be cleared on node restart. This would make writes count against container memory instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We could add an init container that runs &lt;code>rm $PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR/*.db&lt;/code> on startup. This might impact pod start time slightly but is the simplest solution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We could make the application delete &lt;code>$PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR/*.db&lt;/code> on startup.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

Here are the key requirements and components for building a reliable metrics system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="requirements-for-a-metrics-system">Requirements for a Metrics System
&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Multidimensional Data Model&lt;/strong>: The metrics system should support a multidimensional data model that can be sliced and diced along different dimensions as defined by the service (e.g., instance, service, endpoint, method).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Operational Simplicity&lt;/strong>: The system should be easy to operate and maintain, minimizing overhead and complexity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scalable Data Collection&lt;/strong>: The system must support scalable data collection and offer a decentralized architecture, allowing independent teams to set up their own monitoring servers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Powerful Query Language&lt;/strong>: A powerful query language should be available to leverage the data model for alerting and graphing, enabling precise insights into system performance.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="client-libraries">Client Libraries
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Client libraries play an essential role in the metrics system:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>They handle details like thread safety, bookkeeping, and producing the Prometheus text exposition format in response to HTTP requests.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since metrics-based monitoring doesn&amp;rsquo;t track individual events, client library memory usage doesn&amp;rsquo;t increase with more events. Instead, memory usage depends on the number of metrics being tracked.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="instrumentation">Instrumentation
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>To effectively monitor different types of services, appropriate instrumentation methods must be used. Here are three common types of services and how they should be instrumented:&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="online-serving-systems">Online-Serving Systems
&lt;/h4>&lt;p>For online-serving systems, such as web services, the &lt;strong>RED Method&lt;/strong> is used. This method involves tracking:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Requests&lt;/strong>: The count of incoming requests.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Errors&lt;/strong>: The count of failed requests.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Duration&lt;/strong>: The latency or response time of requests.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For example, a cache might track these metrics for both overall performance and for cache misses that need to be recalculated or fetched from a backend.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="offline-serving-systems">Offline-Serving Systems
&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Offline-serving systems, such as log processors, usually batch up work and consist of multiple stages in a pipeline with queues in between. These systems run continuously, which distinguishes them from batch jobs. The &lt;strong>USE Method&lt;/strong> is used for these types of systems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Utilization&lt;/strong>: How much of the system&amp;rsquo;s capacity is in use (e.g., how much work is in progress).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Saturation&lt;/strong>: The amount of queued work and how much work is currently being processed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Errors&lt;/strong>: Any errors encountered during processing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="batch-jobs">Batch Jobs
&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Batch jobs are processes that run at scheduled intervals. The key metrics for batch jobs include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Run Time&lt;/strong>: How long it took for the job to complete.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Stage Duration&lt;/strong>: How long each stage of the job took to complete.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Success Time&lt;/strong>: The time at which the job last succeeded.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Alerts can be set for when the job hasn&amp;rsquo;t succeeded within a certain time frame.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Idempotency for Batch Jobs&lt;/strong>: Idempotency is an important concept for batch jobs. It means that performing an operation more than once has the same effect as performing it only once, which is crucial for reliability and preventing unintended side effects.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
