Updating as I read the book

## The Cat ate my source code

Provide solutions and not excuses. In the book, the cat while playing with a laser pointer ate the source code and owner uses that as an excuse. My key takeaway was that its okay to make mistakes, but always have options.

## Good-enough software

Good enough software doesn't mean its okay to build sloppy code. Codebase that is simple, has automated testing and deployment, meets security and privacy standards and most importantly satisfies core user requirements. The additional bells and whistles can be added later. For eg. Give the user a `not implemented` message.

Building software is all about trade-offs. Speed over perfection maybe a better solution
