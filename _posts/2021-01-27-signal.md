When deploying a containerized application to a container management system like AWS Fargate, you tend to run your application from a shell script. Suppose your script looks like this

```sh
set -o nounset
set -x
gunicorn --config config/gunicorn/$GUNICORN_CONFIG.py config.wsgi
```

Here we are executing the gunicorn service with PID 1 when the container is deployed. Suppose we want to terminate the container with a `docker stop <container_id>`, the command will send a `SIGTERM` to the container. As the gunicorn process is PID 1, this signal is ignored.

The way to resolve this issue is to use `exec` before the command to start your application. The last line of the above shell script should be  `gunicorn --config config/gunicorn/$GUNICORN_CONFIG.py config.wsgi`. A simple example is shown below

`t.py:`

```python
import signal
import time

got_signal = False

def process_signal(signum, frame):
    global got_signal
    got_signal = True

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, process_signal)
    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, process_signal)

    while not got_signal:
        time.sleep(1)
        print("looping...")

    print("Ended with signal.")
```

`entry.sh:`

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec python ./t.py
```

`Dockerfile:`

```docker
FROM python:3.7
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . .

CMD [ "./entry.sh" ]
```

```sh
With the exec:

$ docker run --rm -t signal
looping...
looping...
looping...
looping...
looping...
looping...
Ended with signal.
$ 
Without the exec:

$ docker run --rm -t signal
looping...
looping...
looping...
looping...
looping...
looping...
$
```

Both times, you can run `docker stop` in another window. If the container doesn’t stop within 10 seconds, then it’s killed.

Most apps do not explicitely handle `SIGTERM` the way `t.py` does. If you replace `t.py` with 

```python
import time

while True:
    time.sleep(1)
    print("looping...")

print("Ended with signal.")
```

`SIGINT` will work with keyboard interrupt but `docker stop` does not because of `PID=1` issue.

If we run docker with a `--init` option to force a non `1` PID, the `docker stop` works whether we use `exec` in the script or not.

In order to use this feature with AWS Fargate, make a small change to your `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition` in your cloudformation as shown below

```yaml
ContainerDefinitions:
    - Name: <container_name>
        Image: <container_image>
        Essential: "true"
        linuxParameters:
            initProcessEnabled: "true"
```
