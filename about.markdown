On the tech side of things, I love python, cloud application tooling(esp AWS) and thinking about system architecture.

Outside of tech, I love playing football(soccer), cricket and ping pong. I am an avid Liverpool football club fan and often wake up early in the morning(I live in the Bay Area and LFC is an English club) to watch them play.
So in short a simple guy that is trying to build skills.
