A polyglot and pragrammatic programmer with an M.S. in Electrical Engineering. I have a background in systems engineering and love building tools for automation.

Outside of tech, I love playing football (soccer), cricket and ping pong. I am an avid Liverpool football club fan and often wake up early in the morning (I live in the Bay Area and LFC is an English club) to watch them play.
