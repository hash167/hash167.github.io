&lt;p&gt;The Go compiler can compile the Go source go with different go specs. Fo example, if you have installed go 1.14, you can compile your source with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Go spec 1.13&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rules-for-which-version-of-the-go-spec-used-during-compilation-appear-to-be&quot;&gt;The rules for which version of the Go spec used during compilation appear to be&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your source code is stored within the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GOPATH&lt;/code&gt; (or you have disabled modules with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GO111MODULE=off&lt;/code&gt;) then the version of the Go spec used to compile matches the version of the compiler you are using. ie if you have go 1.13 installed then the go spec used will be 1.13&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your source code is outside the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GOPATH&lt;/code&gt;(or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GO111MODULE=on&lt;/code&gt;), then the go tool will take the version from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If no &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; file is provided, then same as point 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are in module mode(see point 2) and no version is specified in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; file, then &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;go 1.13&lt;/code&gt; is used by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last point is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Go Spec</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Zen of Python</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/book/2020/04/07/zen-of-python.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Zen of Python" /><published>2020-04-07T18:54:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-04-07T18:54:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/book/2020/04/07/zen-of-python</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/book/2020/04/07/zen-of-python.html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I came across &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\'&lt;/span&gt;t special enough to &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;break &lt;/span&gt;the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--obvious&lt;/span&gt; way to &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do &lt;/span&gt;it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\'&lt;/span&gt;re Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;right&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\'&lt;/span&gt;s a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\'&lt;/span&gt;s &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do &lt;/span&gt;more of those!

  &lt;li&gt;Timing functions. Almost always the first example on StackOverflow. (You can always use a Context Manager for these too, writing them is a good way to learn those and their &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__enter__&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__exit__&lt;/code&gt; dunders.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retrying functions. Bonus points for having longer times between tries per try.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting a maximum time for a function to finish executing, if the function is amenable to it (e.g. it runs in a loop)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Logging functions. There are tons of different types of these (and some PyPI packages that are based on this), because there are tons of different use cases for logging. They generally require a decorator factory or class, because they require parameters (such as the logger instance).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simple debugging, sending a function’s inputs and outputs to a log or just stdout
Validating function inputs. Python is EAFP rather than LBYL, but it’s still useful to validate inputs sometimes depending on use case. I’ve written classes that use the same decorator with a bunch of different methods. It’s also handy to CHANGE inputs if they’re in the wrong format, e.g. if the user forgets to start a url with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt;, you can add it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Validating function outputs, for example setting a max/min.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waiting/rate-limiting. Don’t want that web service to ban you for pinging them too frequently!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Caching/memoization. If you’ve got an pure/idempotent (i.e. a functional programming pagradigm functions) that’s also expensive (big O/long running time) that you run several times, sometimes with the same inputs, why not cache the results so you don’t have to recalculate from scratch? Eg: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;functools.lru_cache&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gracefully handling database transactions, e.g. rolling back if there’s an Exception (although many DB-API packages come with their own ways to set this up)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Synchronization, i.e. acquiring and releasing locks in multithreading/multiprocessing applications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authentication (this is what some web framework decorators do, i.e. make sure a user is logged in before they are allowed to do some task/access some resource)&lt;/li&gt;
